# jQuery - Events Challenge

## Instructions

 Using the card panel example we worked on in the last lesson:

* Inside your script.js file, add a click event which will trigger when a &lt;p&gt; tag is clicked and will change the color of all &lt;p&gt; tags to red.
* When a &lt;h2&gt; is hovered over, the background of all &lt;h2&gt;s are changed to the colour lightblue.
* When a &lt;h2&gt; is hovered over its font size increases, but only for that particular &lt;h2&gt;
* When a button is hovered, the background color of the page turns black.
* When a button is no longer hovered, the background color of the page turns grey.
